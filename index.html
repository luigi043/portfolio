        <h3>Project: Markdown Editor</h3>
      
        <!-- Descrição do Projeto -->
        <p>
          During my internship at Redshift III Innovation, I worked on the development of a dynamic <strong>Markdown Editor</strong>. This tool allows users to create documents and see a real-time preview, making the process of working with Markdown easier and more intuitive. The project focused on using modern technologies such as <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>, and <strong>TypeScript</strong> to build a robust and efficient web application.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project involved both <strong>Front-end</strong> and <strong>Back-end</strong> development, ensuring that the integration between the user interface and the server-side logic was seamless. The end goal was to provide an easy-to-use and responsive interface while maintaining excellent performance on the back-end.
